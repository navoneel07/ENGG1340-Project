# StudentManage
## A Project for CSII

A student management system for the student body of HKU written in C++11, made for the course ENGG1340.

**Abstract**
HKU has a large body of students, both current and previous. It is quite imperative to have a system to effectively and efficiently manage all students so as have relevant and accurate student data at hand. This project aims to create such an information and management system using C++11. A basic student member would have data associated such as:
    UID [Primary key]
    Name
    Year
    Faculty
    Curriculum
    Status [Fulltime/ Exchange] --> if exchange, then Home Institution

Upon running a query on a particular student, Further data is shown divided into:
    **Academic**
        Show all courses past and current
        Show courses pending for approval
        Give GPA for previous semester, Current expected GPA bases on linear regression and current CGPA
        Show total credits accumulated

    **Financial**
        Show due payments - the amount, due date and overdue, **if any**
        Show past payments

Basic **features** of the system include:
1. Add a new student (upon admission)
2. Show all students
3. sort by criteria and filter out specific students according to a criteria
4. Search for a specific student.
5. modify student record, including approval of courses, posting of grades, calculating new GPA etc.
6. Delete/transfer a student depending upon the situation: delete when drop-out and transfer when pass out from the current to alumni database.

For alumni, itâ€™s more or less the same, except GPA is unmodifiable, and new fields like year of graduation etc will be available.
